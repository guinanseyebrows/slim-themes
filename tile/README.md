## Installation
Copy the theme files to this directory:

    /usr/share/slim/themes/tile

Edit the SLiM configuration file and change the theme:

    /etc/slim.conf

## Bugs
FYI: If you have a -really- long username, the text will "cut off". To fix this, simply change the font size values in the theme file to a smaller one of your choice.
